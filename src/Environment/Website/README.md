# Website Deployment Module

The primary purpose of this module is managing the build/publish of the
solution to a Sitecore instance using Helix Publishing Pipeline.

This module exists outside the traditional Helix layers, as it does not
relate to any given business domain and exists purely for the purpose of
assisting deployment.
